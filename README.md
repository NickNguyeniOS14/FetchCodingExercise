# FetchCodingExercise

Please write an (Android/iOS) app that retrieves the data from https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring.json.

Display this list of items to the user based on the following requirements:

Display all the items grouped by "listId"
Sort the results first by "listId" then by "name" when displaying.
Filter out any items where "name" is blank or null.
The final result should be displayed to the user in an easy-to-read list.

Please make the project buildable on the latest (non-pre release) tools and supporting the current release mobile OS.
